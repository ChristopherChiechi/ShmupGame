## About
Uchugun is a shoot 'em up game created over the course of about two months using the LARC Engine. It is based on the Japanese arcade game "Ikaruga."
The LARC Engine is a closed source engine created by Dr. Ian Parberry, but the documentation can be found [here](https://larc.unt.edu/code/engine/index.html).
